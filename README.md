# Wildfire prediction using IA

## Introduction
Wildfires is an problematic natural risk, with each year a new increased collection of catastrophic events. Many reasons are behind the growing number of such events and they are mainly related to climate changes and to the extension of the wildland urban interface. The 2021 summer was a saison of record devastation especialy in Northern Hemisphere with an intense wildfire hotspot around Mediterranean Basin (cf. image below). Prevention policies based on scientific projects based on prediction and  management measures have become extremely important.
