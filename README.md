# Wildfire prediction using IA

## Introduction
Wildfires is an problematic natural risk, with each year a new increased collection of catastrophic events causing humain, economic and ecological damages. Many reasons are behind the growing number of such events and they are mainly related to climate changes and the urbain extensions in the wildland. The last summer was a saison of record devastation especialy in Northern Hemisphere. Prevention policies with a scientific aproach based on prediction and management measures have become extremely important. 

## Wildfire modeling

* Physical based models: 

Several research works in the understanding of the basic physical mechanisms governing the behavior of wildfires. In order to study the effects in wildfires spread, numerical simulation using a fully-physical fire model have the potential to accurately predict the parameters of interest and provide the basic information needed for proper description of  the fire propagation processes like heat transfers and  chemical  kinetics . 

The limiation of this kind of models is their complexity, coupling multi-phase equations with a large number of parameters is not trivial. The resulting simulations can be very computationally intensive and need a lot of resources. But, the reduced models [1] can be used for the calibration of parameters for other type of approches based on semi-physical or laboratory models for example.

* Empirical based models:

applying a statistically-based regression model,  motivated by the desire [2].
